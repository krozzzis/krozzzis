## About Me

Hey! I'm just a guy who loves messing around with low-level programming, Rust, and whatever else catches my eye. I enjoy making things run faster, breaking stuff to see how it works, and customizing my Linux setup way more than I probably should. If it involves systems programming, compilers, or decentralized tech, I'm in. Oh, and I might be slightly obsessed with mechanical keyboards.

## Tech Stack & Interests

- **Languages:** Rust, Python, C++
- **Focus Areas:** Systems Programming, Compiler Design, AI, a little bit of Web3
- **Tools & Environment:** ArchLinux, Neovim, [Jorne Split Keyboard](https://github.com/joric/jorne)
